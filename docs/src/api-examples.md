## Deconstructin the Solution

While some of the questions that I previously listed can be answered by reading the AWS Solutions documentation, or even better contacting your AWS account manager or AWS Solutions Architect, some of the questions are more complex and require a deep dive into the Solution.

These questions are really what I am interested in. 
Each AWS solution is typically assocaited with one GitHub solution repository, which includes different artifacts,Infrastructure as a Code, code, scripts, documentation. for me "deconstructing the solution" means looking at the code, the architecture, the documentation, and the deployment script, and fully understanding how the solution works.

Knowing that the solution is built on the best practices, and that it is secure, I can then start to think about how I can extend the solution, or how I can build my own solution based on the same principles.

## Getting Help

With the advent of Generative AI tools like Amazon Q, but also Copilot, OpenAI Codex, I can now get help in understanding the code, and even generate new code based on the code that I am looking at.

In my journey to become a Solution Creator, I selected Amazon Q Developer as my companion.

I am looking at the AWS Solutions as a starting point, and I am looking at the AWS Solutions as a way to learn about the best practices, and to learn about the AWS services that I can use to build my own solutions.

So Amazon Q developer, welcome to the team and let us start deconstructin a solution.


## Selecting a solution to start with

When you visit [AWS Solutions](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/) you will see that a list of solutions that you can start with is pretty long. Solutions are grouped within the AWS Solutions, Partner Solutions and Guidance.

### Why should you care for a partner solution

Year after year AWS has been selected by Garther as the leading provider of cloud services in the category of operational excellence. This includes in itself not only the offer of AWS managed services but also the partner solutions, SaaS offerings by leading vendors in their categories, that our customer can use with the confidence that AWS infrastructure is designed for security and that AWS will help them integrate their presered products within overal infrastructure designed to meet business needs.

### Solutions vs. Guidance

Solutions are pre-built, customizable, and tested reference architectures designed to solve common customer problems. Customer deploy solutions in their own accounts and can customize them as needed. Guidance is a set of best practices, whitepapers, and other resources that help you understand how to use AWS services to build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for your applications.

## The plan of reconstructing the solution

[The AWS Solutions Library](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/)  is a great place to start and I  recommend starting with a solution that you are interested in, and that you think you can extend or build upon.

For this reconstruction endevor I plan to do 100 AWS Solutions and Guidances, and I will document my journey in this blog.
