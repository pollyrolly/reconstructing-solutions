# Introduction

Since I started to work with AWS almost two years ago, I absolutely fell in love with AWS Solutions. I am a Solutions Architect but I also worked as a DevOps and MLOps engineer and I am enthusiastic of all things GenAI. 

As a builder at hearth, I love to learn about and use different developer tools, and I believe that as a DevOps you need access to many different tools. Myself, being a big fan of Infrastructure as Code (IoC) I do sometimes use AWS Console.

As of IoC, in my professional life I had a lot of fun with writing Terraform modules, and also had some reading session of AWS CloudFormation modules.

So learning about AWS Solutions, I started to look at their implementations to undestand if I could build end-to-end my own Solution. I am curious if I have skills and understanding of AWS methodology to build a Solution that would be useful for others.

But what are the AWS Solutions?  So let's dive into it.

# What are AWS Solutions?

AWS Solutions are pre-built, customizable, and tested reference architectures designed to solve common customer problems. Customer deploy solutions in their own accounts and can customize them as needed.

2. AWS Solutions provide proven, best-practice architectures that can accelerate the development of applications and services on AWS. 
  - We often use the term "one click deployment" but you can ask yourself a question: "Is it really one click deployment? What skills do I need to have to deploy a Solution?"
  
3. They cover a wide range of use cases, from simple web applications to complex, enterprise-grade systems. Examples include serverless web apps, data lakes, IoT solutions, and more.

- How do I know what version I am using? 
- Do I have support on the Solutions deployed in my accout?
- Can AWS manage the Solutions by deploying new versions?
