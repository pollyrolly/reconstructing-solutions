# Solutions Creation Project

Here I would like to structure the end to end process of creating a Solution from the idea, to the diegram , implementation, documentation, helping customers deploy them, monitoring the usage of the Solution, updating the solution, and finally retiring the Solution.
While some of the processes are common for all Solutions, some of them are unique to the Solution. 

## Solution Idea

How do solutions come into life?

## Solution Architecture

How do you draw the architecture diagram? 
Do architectures evolve over time?
How is security embedded into each solution.

## Solution Implementation

Making a decision of the technology stack.
Which tools do you use to implement the solution? 
What Infrastructure as a Code (IoC) frameworks do you use and why?
How do you test the solution?
Designing for customization and extensibility.

## Solution Documentation

How do you document the solution?
What are the key components of the documentation?
How do you keep the documentation up to date?
What are the prefered tools taht make creating documentation fast and efficient?

## Solution Deployment

Best-practice deployment workflows.
Role of the user and how AWS support the deployment.
Who to ask to help you deploy the solution?

## Solution Monitoring

Who to ask when solution is not workng
The costs of monitoring the solution

## Solution Updates

How do you update the solution?

## Solution Retirement

How do you retire the solution?
